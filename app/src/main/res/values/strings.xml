    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_1">It is automatically acquired once you leave Vale and enter the
    overworld for the first time, where a cutscene has Flint talk to you and give a tutorial on how to use Djinn. It will join you
    no matter how many times you attempt to refuse it joining you, but its various responses may be amusing.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_1" formatted="false">When Flint is used in battle, the user strongly attacks a target with
    a Venus-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack increased by 60%.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_2">Forge resides in Goma Cave, on an elevated ledge near a person bystanding on the
    ground level. An earth pillar near the bystander and the Djinni must be pushed right, then up onto the circular indentation in the
    ground where the pillar will stay permanently. Then the party continues to go through the dungeon, and will eventually make it to
    the elevated portion of the area where they can hop across the earth pillar and initiate the battle with Forge.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_2" formatted="false">When Forge is used in battle, all currently active and alive Adepts get
    buffed with a 25% temporary increase to their respective attack ratings.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_location_3">Bilibin</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_3">Gust is located in a cavern underneath the town of Bilibin. The gold statue of
    Lady McCoy in the center of the town conceals an entrance into the area, and can be moved aside so the entrance can be accessed;
    players will find out that though they can see Gust off to the right of the screen, they cannot reach it because of the placement
    of another gold statue against a wall. The actual method of getting to Gust is to go up the stairs to the right of the statue outside,
    and walk down until you\'re walking on top of the town\'s wooden gate permiter clockwise. A cave entrance at the west end of the town
    leads to the same underground cave, but now you stand just to the left of the gold statue. Cast Move to move the statue one space down,
    and now you can hop right to where Gust awaits.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_3" formatted="false">When Gust is used in battle, the user attacks a target with a Jupiter-based
    attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an aditional 10 damage points added to the result. There is then a
    chance that all of the resulting damage will be doubled, signified by a second strike to the attack visually.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_3">When set, Gust increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Attack by 2, and base Agility by 2.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_4">Granite is visible in the town of Kolima, fenced in a small enclosure next to one of the
    tree-houses, and you cannot reach it from the outside. To reach it, go behind the tree-house and walk down, so that you enter a secret
    back door into a small room. Following the ladder and the resultant underground cave trail (complete with random battles) leads you into the
    enclosed area with the Djinni ready for grabbing.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_4" formatted="false">When Granite is used in battle, all currently active and alive Adepts are
    buffed for until the end of the turn with a protective effect that decreases all damage done to them from enemy attacks by 50%. This
    effect has the "strikes first" property, meaning it will be the first performed action in a given turn regardless of the agility rating
    of the user and any other unit in battle.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_4">When set, Granite increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Defense by 2, base Agility by 2, and

    <string name="golden_sun_location_5">Tret Tree</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_5">Breeze resides in the Tret Tree dungeon-style location, in the upper-rightmost corner
    of the large exterior screen comprising of tree branches to climb up through. It is obscured by the leafy aspect of the scenery that gets
    cleared away by the "aura vision" surrounding Isaac as he approaches, so to know it is there you would have to walk up to the end of the
    topmost branches and reveal it. It must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_5" formatted="false">When Breeze is used in battle, all currently active and alive Adepts are
    buffed with an additional 40 resistance points to all their resistances.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_location_6">Imil</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_6">Fever reposes in Imil Falls Cave, the tiny cavern at the town of Imil, reachable by sliding
    around through the frozen river and into the hole of the frozen waterfall. To reach there, first you have to stand in front of the snowman
    at the north end of the town and cast Move to shift it left and drop it onto the frozen river below. Then entering the river via the opening
    just to the right of the sanctum in the southwest part of town, slide right, up, left, up, left, up, right, up, left, up, right, and up
    to enter the opening. You automatically slide into Fever, and press A to immediately add it to your collection.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_6" formatted="false">When Fever is used in battle, the user attacks a target and an orange cloud is
    let loose upon impact, dealing a Mars-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 30 damage points
    added to the result. There is then a chance that the target will be afflicted by Delusion.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_6">When set, Fever increases the Adept\'s base HP by 8, base Attack by 3, and base Agility by 2.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_location_7">Mercury Lighthouse</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_7">Fizz is a Djinni that is automatically handed to you as you play through the game, being
    present on Mia as soon as she joins your party in Mercury Lighthouse somewhat early on in Golden Sun. Aside from Flint, Fizz is the only
    Djinni in the game that is impossible not to obtain.</string>

    by an amount equal to 60% of their maximum HP.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_8">Sleet is located in a hidden room behind one of the many waterfall-walls in a hallway
    immediately following a room where a pipe spout pushes open a massive section of wall to the left to reveal a door; you must press up
    against the wall so that you enter the room as though you walked through a house\'s door. It must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_8" formatted="false">When Sleet is used in battle, an image of a Mercury Djinni projects a stream
    of icy shards at the target, dealing a Mercury-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 30
    damage points added to the result. There is then a chance that the target\'s Attack rating will be temporarily reduced by 25%.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_8">When set, Sleet increases the Adept\'s base HP by 12, base Attack by 3, and base Luck by 1.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_9">Boost party Agility with a swift wind</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_9">Fuchin Falls Cave</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_9">Zephyr is located in the Fuchin Falls Cave dungeon, in a room with water that is crossed by
    rolling logs. It shouldn\'t be hard to figure out how to reach it, which is by rolling on the top horizontal log down, rolling the lower left
    vertical log one space left, rolling the horizontal log back up, hopping to the lower left vertical log, and rolling it right. Zephyr must
    be battled to be obtained.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_9" formatted="false">When Zephyr is used in battle, all currently active and alive Adepts get their
    Agility ratings temporarily buffed to +100%, the maximum agility bonus possible. It doubles everyone\'s speed, in other words.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_9">When set, Zephyr increases the Adept\'s base HP by 10, base PP by 3, base Agility by 2, and base Luck

    <string name="golden_sun_location_10">Mogall Forest</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_10">Quartz is located late in Mogall Forest. In a screen you enter down from the top end,
    to the right of the screen is a rock right below a horizontal log - position yourself above the log and use Move to move the rock down
    one space into the circular indenture in the ground, then push the log down. Push a second horizontal log down, push the vertical log
    from the right to left, and go down and left to reach the Djinni. It must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_10" formatted="false">When Quartz is used in battle, a targeted downed party member has a 50%
    chance to be revived, with their HP restored to 50% of their maximum HP.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_element_11">Mercury</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_11">Lull a foe into deep sleep</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_11">Xian</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_11">Mist is visibly located in the town of Xian. To get to it, note a woman that patrols
    between the river and the right of two brown doors embedded into a brown wall below the town\'s dojo. As soon as you talk to her, a
    Frostable puddle appears beneath her, and she berates you for making her drop her bucket of water. Talk to her when there is one tile
    between herself and the door she stops in front of, and use Frost on the resultant puddle to form a pillar you can hop across to reach
    the Djinni to the right.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_11" formatted="false">When Mist is used in battle, the user deals an attack that lets loose a
    white vaporous cloud on impact, dealing a Mercury-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack, increased by 30%.
    The target may be afflicted with Sleep.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_element_12">Mars</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_12">Boost party defense with a heat aura</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_12">World Map, north of Xian</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_12">Corona is the first Djinni players can come across in Golden Sun that is randomly
    encountered in a specific area of the overworld that otherwise appears to be pointless scenery. Thus, it is almost always missed by
    players playing the game the first time without any outside information. The battle with Corona may ensue in place of a random battle
    at the end of a vertical stretch of land parallel to the Mogall Forest region in Angara, in the pictured "island" north of Xian, and
    Corona then, of course, must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_12" formatted="false">When Corona is used in battle, all currently active and alive Adepts
    get buffed with a 25% temporary increase to their respective defense ratings.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_location_13">Altin Peak</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_13">Spritz is located in a larger room in the lower portion of the multi-level Altin
    Peak dungeon. It is immediately visible as soon as you enter the room. To reach it, cast Frost on a puddle on ground level, and move
    the earth pillar to the left of that one space left, constructing a hoppable path to the elevated area containing a mine cart. Also
    interact with a switch so that the arrow pointing right points left. Hop into the mine cart and ride it twice in a row, and you will
    be dropped off to Spritz\' position.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_13" formatted="false">When Spritz is used in battle, all currently alive and battling Adepts
    have their HP restored by 30% of their respective maximum HP values.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_13">When set, Spritz increases the Adept\'s base HP by 8, base PP by 4, and base Agility by 3.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_name_14">Smog</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_element_14">Jupiter</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_14">Veil a foe\'s vision in smoke</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_14">Lamakan Desert</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_14">Smog is located in the second, large area of Lamakan Desert, but it cannot be
    seen or interacted with unless you cast the Reveal Psynergy in its vicinity. When you enter the screen from the lower right, first
    go immediately upward to a circle of stones that contains an oasis when you cast Reveal near it. From there, go northwest to a
    conjoined pair of circles of stones. The right circle contains an Ant Lion pit, while the left circle contains Smog.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_14" formatted="false">When Smog is used in battle, the user attacks the target and a vaporous
    blue cloud is let loose on impact, dealing a Jupiter-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional
    60 damage points added to the result. There is then a chance that the target will be afflicted with Delusion.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_14">When set, Smog increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9 and base Attack by 3.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_name_15">Vine</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_element_15">Venus</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_15">Tangle foes to drop agility</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_15">World Map, west of Lamakan Desert</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_15">Vine is a Djinni that is randomly encountered in a specific area of the
    overworld that otherwise appears to be pointless scenery. Thus, it is very often missed by players playing the game the first time
    without any outside information. The battle with Vine may ensue in place of a random battle in the circular "island" to the
    immediate northwest of where you exit Lamakan Desert, led to by the upper of two bridges that are immediately visible. It can
    also appear on the larger island just north of crescent shaped one. Furthermore, it may also appear on the strip of land north
    of the exit between the mountains and the river.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_15" formatted="false">When Vine is used in battle, a group of wriggling green vines briefly
    sprout out of the ground at the position of the enemy party. All enemies\' agility ratings are temporarily lowered down to 50%, the
    lowest value the Agility rating can be debuffed down to.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_15">When set, it increases the Adept\'s base HP by 12, base PP by 4, base Defense by 3, and base
    Luck by 1.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_name_16">Scorch</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_element_16">Mars</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_16">Stun a foe with a blast attack</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_16">Kalay Tunnel</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_16">Scorch is present in the portion of Kalay Tunnel accessible from the upper
    right cave entrance in the main town area of Kalay as soon as you arrive to Kalay for the first time. Upon entering the tunnel
    through the cave entrance concealed by a statue at the upper right of the town area, you are immediately in Scorch\'s vicinity.
    Push the nearby statue all the way left so that it blocks the water flowing out of the wall, and simply climb to Scorch and
    collect it.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_16" formatted="false">When Scorch is used in battle, the user attacks a target and
    produces a fiery explosion upon impact, dealing a Mars-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack
    with an additional 50 damage points added to the result. There is then a chance that the target will be afflicted by Stun.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_16">When set, Scorch increases the Adept\'s base HP by 8 and base Attack by 3.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_name_17">Sap</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_element_17">Venus</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_17">Attack a foe and steal HP</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_17">Vault</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_17">Sap is present in the town of Vault, but the requirement to attain it is
    quite involved and easy to unknowingly make mistakes about. First, in the town area, climb and make your way all the way to the
    wooden watch tower at the north end of the town, and interact with the dangling bell next to the NPC; a hollow ringing noise will
    prompt Sap to hop out of its hiding place in the nearby tree to an elevated area next to a cave exit. Then, go to the cemetery
    where the dog is, cast Reveal, climb down the revealed ladder, and complete the Vault Cave optional dungeon. At the end of the
    dungeon, you will exit out into the open out of said cave exit, and Sap will be sitting nearby in the spot you hounded it to,
    ready to be collected. In other words, Sap is the "end reward" of the Vault Cave dungeon, but only if you remember to place it as
    the dungeon\'s end reward first.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_17" formatted="false">When Sap is used in battle, the user strikes the target and siphons
    a glowing yellow energy out of it, dealing a Venus-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an
    additional 50 damage points added to the result. Then the user\'s HP will be restored by an amount equal to 50% of the damage
    dealt to the target. If the target dies, the user\'s HP is restored by half of the target\'s health before the attack.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_17">When set, Sap increases the Adept\'s base HP by 10, base Attack by 3, and base Luck by 1.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_name_18">Kite</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_element_18">Jupiter</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_18">Attack twice next round</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_18">Vale Cave</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_18">Kite resides in the optional Vale Cave dungeon area. Right before reaching the
    area it initially sits on in the cave, you open a chest containing the Halt Psynergy, and as soon as you approach Kite it flies
    down into an area below. When you reach it, it prevents itself from being caught by flying around the series of rocks opposite
    of yourself in tandem. When you are positioned exactly parallel of Kite, use your newfound Halt Psynergy to keep it in place so
    you can run around and collect it.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_18" formatted="false">When Kite is used in battle, the targeted Adept will be granted two
    actions the next turn instead of the normal one. The second action the affected Adept will take next turn will always be based
    on that Adept\'s Agility divided by 2, for example, Ivan with an Agility of 400 and Garet with an Agility of 100, Ivan performs
    two normal attacks and Garet performs one, both of Ivan\'s attacks will be performed before Garet performs his - unless the
    battle command taken with that action is an effect that ordinarily goes first in a battle regardless of agility, such as the Mars
    Djinni Flash, in which case the second action\'s priority decrease will not apply.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_18">When set, Kite increases the Adept\'s base HP by 8, base PP by 4, and base Agility by 3.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_name_19">Ember</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_element_19">Mars</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_19">Restore party PP with passion\'s flame</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_19">Tolbi</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_19">Ember is found in the city of Tolbi, in the northeastmost corner of the main
    town area. To get to it, exit out of Tolbi\'s south gate, but not so much that you\'ll exit onto the world map; instead, hug the
    wall to the right and go behind the trees as you go right, then up, to an area where a small plant lies at the bottom of a wall.
    Use the Growth Psynergy, then climb up to where there is a puddle and use Frost on it. Then retrace your steps back to the town\'s
    front gate - again, making sure not to mistakenly exit the town area into the overworld, since that will reset the plant and the
    ice pillar - and go to the inn at the upper right area of town. Step onto the top of the ice pillar and hop to the right to collect
    Ember.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_19" formatted="false">When Ember is used in battle, Ember replenishes the PP meters of all
    current battling Adepts by 7% of their respective maximum PP meters.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_19">When set, Ember increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base PP by 4, base Defense by 2, and
    base Agility by 2.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_flavor_20">Freeze a foe to drop its defense</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_location_20">World Map, south of Altmiller Cave</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_20">Hail is a Djinni that is randomly encountered in a specific area of the
    overworld that otherwise appears to be pointless scenery. Thus, it is very often missed by players playing the game the first
    time without any outside information. The battle with Hail may ensue in place of a random battle in the stretch of land to the
    southwest of Altmiller Cave, possibly as soon as the player crosses the bridge.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_20" formatted="false">When Hail is used in battle, the lower half of the screen quickly
    gets overtaken by a frozen "ocean" that blasts the enemy once from underneath, dealing a Mercury-based attack equal in power to
    the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 40 damage points added to the result. There is then a chance that the
    target\'s Defense rating will be temporarily reduced by 25%.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_20">When set, Hail increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Attack by 4, and base Luck by 1.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_location_21">Kalay Docks</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_21">Ground is located at the top end of Kalay Docks, and is visible to players
    entering Kalay Port for the first time - it cannot be had until later in the game, though. It can only be reached once you\'ve
    sailed across the Karagol Sea and made it to the other side in Gondowan. Then, by going east from the entrance to Altmiller

    will be right next to the Djinni, waiting to be collected.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_21" formatted="false">When Ground is used in battle, the user summons an array of energy
    spheres that slowly gather into the target\'s position, causing the target to be "unable to move" for one of its actions this
    turn (meaning the enemy cannot attack at all this turn if it can only act once per turn, whereas a boss that can act twice a
    turn can only act once a turn). This acts first in battle regardless of the Agility ratings of the user and the target, and it
    shares its priority with other "acts first" moves.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_21">When set, Ground increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base PP by 3, and base Agility by 3.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_22">Squall is located in a lower floor in Altmiller Cave, visible behind a
    puzzle in one room that is properly lit up. After climbing up the stairs below it, roll the vertical pillar right, roll
    the lower horizontal pillar up, cast Frost on the puddle, roll the lower horizontal pillar back down, go around to the
    right side of the vertical pillar and roll it left, and go up above the upper horizontal pillar and push it down. The
    Djinni now reachable nearby must be battled to be obtained.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_22" formatted="false">When Squall is used in battle, the user attacks a target,
    and a purple bolt of lightning strikes the target in tandem with the impact, dealing a Jupiter-based attack equal in
    power to the user\'s normal physical attack increased by 40%. There is then a chance that the target will be afflicted
    by Stun.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_23">Tonic is located in Lunpa Fortress, in a room connected to Donpa\'s bedroom that
    is inaccessible the first time you sneak into and complete the optional dungeon. After defeatingToadonpa and letting Hammet be
    brought back to Kalay, you are allowed to sneak back into Lunpa Fortress. Make your way all the way back to Donpa\'s bedroom again,
    and in a cutscene Donpa will thank you for your help and let you enter a room to collect Tonic, which he claims is a creature he
    "fought once long ago" - this seems to contradict the main plot in that the Djinn were only released into the world for the first
    time at the beginning of the game, though it is possible Donpa encountered Tonic as soon as it was released and that it was "long"
    since then in his perspective.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_23" formatted="false">When Tonic is used in battle, all status ailments from all current
    battling Adepts are removed, including the likes of haunt.</string>

    middle-left area. Before you climb down a short wall onto the sandy ground below, where you would be chased by the huge tornado
    containing the Storm Lizard boss, cast Reveal to see a series of small black footsteps leading up to the left. Cast Reveal at
    where they would end to show that there is an otherwise invisible earth pillar against a wall that you can hop across to the left.
    Flash is in plain sight after that, and it must be defeated in battle to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_24" formatted="false">When Flash is used in battle, all damage done to all current battling
    party members is reduced by 90% for the duration of that turn, and this effect is always cast first regardless of the user\'s Agility.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_25">Dew is located in the third screen of Suhalla Gate, on a partially elevated
    portion of land reachable only by sliding down a cliff slide from the top portion of the area. There are multiple cliff slides
    in the screen, and you have to slide down the correct one to drop right next to the Djinni; it is the third cliff slide from the
    left that you need to drop down. Dew must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_25" formatted="false">When Dew is used in battle, a downed party member has an 80% chance to be revived and
    their HP meter is restored to 80% of their maximum HP meter.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_26">Bane is located in the sixth floor of the optional Crossbone Isle. The entire
    room is a puzzle maze that must be fully solved in order to both exit it and get the Djinni, with the idea being to hound it to
    the elevated portion at the lower right of the room and trap it with Halt like on Kite at Vale Cave.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_26">When Bane is used in battle, the user attacks and a vaporous red cloud is let loose
    upon impact. It deals a Venus-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 60 damage
    points, and there is a chance that the target will be afflicted with the Deadly Poison status condition.</string>

    <string name="golden_sun_catching_description_27">Torch is located on a rooftop of Lalivero that is somewhat tricky to reach. You
    would have to enter the Weapon and Armor shop to the lower right of the town, climb up the ladder to the roof, hop right onto the
    wall that surrounds the town\'s upper perimeter, walk the wall counterclockwise until you\'re on a rooftop on the upper left of
    town that has one lone pot on it, hop right to the building to the right of that, and climb up the green vine to collect Torch.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_battle_effect_27" formatted="false">When Torch is used in battle, the screen is briefly lit up with a
    wavy, oscillating heat effect, and the target is hit by a Mars-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack
    with an additional 30 damage points added to the result. There is a chance that when the attack hits, only 50% of the target\'s
    current Defense rating is applied, sharply increasing Torch\'s damage.</string>
    <string name="golden_sun_set_bonus_27">When set, Torch increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Attack by 3, and base Luck by 1.</string>

    large abyss where it appears unreachable. To get to it, in the screen outside the main building with all the wounded workers,
    climb down the ladder to the left, use Move to move the left pillar in the underground one space left, climb back up, climb
    down the ladder underneath the pillar to the right, use Move to move the right pillar one space left, make your way up to back
    outside where a small plant is visible, cast Growth on the plant, climb up and slide down to the elevated entrance into the
    building, and slide down the one slide of three you\'re able to reach in the room you immediately appear in. You will drop
    down to Luff\'s position. Save your game, then attempt to acquire it through battle.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_1">It is automatically acquired once Felix\’s party leaves Daila and enters the
    overworld for the first time, and in a cutscene, Echo talks to him and gives a tutorial on using Djinn. It will join you no
    matter how many times you refuse to let it, but its amusing responses range from outright begging to promising that Felix
    will be “all kinds of strong” and that Echo “won\’t be a burden and eat all your chips or anything.”</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_1" formatted="false">When Echo is used in battle, the user attacks a target with a two-hit
    strike that propels the target into the air, dealing a Venus-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack,
    increased by 60%.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_2">Fog is found in the Kandorean Temple, on an alcove reachable by casting the Lash
    Psynergy on a coiled rope. Lash is the reward at the end of the dungeon, however, acquired in a cutscene with Master Poi after
    coming out of an exit from the cave area back into the temple area. You would have to reenter the exit you came out of and
    backtrack to the Djinni once you have Lash, but it is certainly closer to the dungeon\'s exit than the entrance. After climbing
    up to Fog, you must battle it in order to attain it.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_2" formatted="false">When Fog is used in battle, the user leaps forward to strike the target
    and let loose a vaporous blue cloud upon impact, dealing a Mercury-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical
    attack with an additional 30 damage points. There is then a chance that the target will be afflicted with Delusion.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_3">Breath is located in the Shrine of the Sea God, specifically the earlier portion
    explorable so long as you have the Lash Psynergy from Kandorean Temple. As soon as you use Lash on the coiled rope in the first
    room, a cutscene with the two young boys Riki and Tavi transpires in which they thank you and report that they were trying to
    catch the flying creature for themselves before the tidal wave struck. After they leave, you more or less chase Breath through
    some of the dungeon; one particularly important point to retain is that when you get to three stairwells in close proximity
    to each other, enter one of the two upper stairs and cross a bridge so that Breath is seen fleeing north from the floor below
    you, then return and take the lower stairs. You will then go up to where Breath is, but before attempting to catch it, press
    the lit-up torch against the empty section of wall, so that the Djinni will trap itself and you can battle it.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_3" formatted="false">When Breath is used in battle, target ally Adept is healed by 40% of
    its maximum HP. This effect has the "strikes first" property that guarantees it to occur as the first action in a given turn
    regardless of the user\'s Agility, unless another move with the strikes-first property is used in the same turn, in which case
    Agility will be measured.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_3">When set, Breath increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Defense by 3, and base Agility by 4.</string>

    but only actually acquirable after being chased through the entire location by the player and forcing you to solve
    puzzles it inadvertently creates for you as you proceed after it. Eventually, you corner it in a room where it can
    hop across two separate kinds of pillars if you approach it, but instead of doing that you should climb down and
    use your newly acquired Pound Psynergy to pound down the pillar to the left, then climb back up. Cannon can then
    be battled and acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_4" formatted="false">When Cannon is used in battle, the user charges forward
    to tackle the target while cloaked in a fiery aura, dealing a Mars-based attack equal in power to the user\'s
    normal physical attack with an additional 40 damage points added to the result.</string>

    randomly encountered in a specific area of the overworld that otherwise appears to be featureless scenery. Compared to
    other Djinn found and fought like this, though, Iron is perhaps the only one that players without any form of outside
    help or guidance have a pretty good chance to stumble upon regardless; Iron is located in the green forest bordering the
    left of the town of Madra, so if a random battle occurs while you\'re crossing the forest on the way to Madra, you will
    most likely engage in the battle with Iron. Then, of course, it must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_5" formatted="false">When Iron is used in battle, all currently active and alive
    Adepts get buffed with a 25% temporary increase to their respective defense ratings.</string>

    first time without any outside information. The battle with Sour may ensue in place of a random battle in the pictured
    area northeast of the town of Mikasalla and just below the cavern containing the Megaera summon tablet. It must be defeated
    to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_6" formatted="false">When Sour is used in battle, the user deals a Mercury-based
    attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack increased by 50%. There is then a chance that all of the
    target\'s resistances may be lowered by 40 each. Note that resist-dropping effects may be stacked to a maximum of -80.</string>

    be hopped onto using Poundable wooden pillars - you must pound the pillars that allow you to climb up to the elevated level
    of the screen without pounding any of the pillars you need to use to hop to where Blitz is. From where you enter the screen
    from the lower left, pound the immediately visible left pillar visible, go to the right in the area beyond that, pound the
    rightmost pillar there, and pound the right of the two topmost pillars that are up against the north wall. Climb up the
    resultant ladder, hop left, go down, hop right, go down, hop down once and left twice across the two concurrent wood pillars,
    go down and right, and hop right to reach Blitz\' area, where it must be battled to be obtained. Considering the hefty amount
    of work needed to get onto Blitz\' area, the importance of saving before the battle cannot be stressed enough.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_7" formatted="false">When Blitz is used in battle, the user strikes the target and a
    series of four lightning bolts circle around the target briefly after the strike transpires. The attack deals a Jupiter-based
    attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 30 damage points added to the result, and there
    is then a chance that the target will be afflicted with Stun.</string>

    from a boss fight in Yampi Desert; go to the tiny ranch with the chicken and sheep in the lower left corner of the town, and
    cast Scoop in the exact center to open up a ladder, which leads to an underground cave trail. Following it leads you to the
    Djinni, which you can pick up without a fight.</string>

    acquired there to enter the entrance you see the werewolf that says "What!? Outsiders, here?" exit and reenter. Follow your
    way and eventually trigger a cutscene with the werewolf, Maha. You automatically return to the town\'s inn, and the town is now
    under daylight. Enter the hidden entrance again and return to where you spoke with Maha to trigger another, lengthier cutscene
    with him. Maha will eventually produce the Jupiter Djinni for Felix\'s party to take on their travels (learning from the party
    in the process that the name "Djinni" is what you call creatures like this), and you automatically acquire it. In a sense,
    this is another eventual reward you get for completing Air\'s Rock.</string>

    first time or without a guide, however, may find this Djinni somewhat difficult to acquire as it may not be immediately
    obvious what to do. First of all, reverse all gears in the dungeon - this is necessary to complete the dungeon to begin
    with. Then in one of the upper floors, there are two pink gears side by side rotating downward into what would seem to
    be an abyss, which is what\'s pictured. Step behind the left gear and press down to jump onto it and fall down to the
    floor below; you will land very near Steel, where it can then be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_14" formatted="false">When Steel is used in battle, the user strikes the target
    and siphons a glowing yellow energy out of it, dealing a Venus-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal
    physical attack increased by 30%. The user\'s HP will be restored by an amount equal to 50% of the damage dealt to
    the target. If the target dies, the user\'s HP is restored by half of the target\'s health before the attack.</string>

    accessible only on your return trip back from Kibombo to the north when Piers has joined your party - only he can cast
    the Frost Psynergy needed to reach it. Climb up the first three sets of stairs, go down to Frost the puddle into an ice
    pillar, go up to climb up one more stairway, go right and down to hop across the ice pillar down and right, and cast
    Growth and climb up it to reach the Djinni. Waft must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_15" formatted="false">When Waft is used in battle, a holographic image of a Jupiter
    Djinni floats above the target and surrounds the target with a purple pillar of energy, dealing a Jupiter-based attack

    first have to have collected the Healing Fungus from the Gondowan Cliffs (this item is accessible by casting Frost on a
    puddle over there and using the resulting pillar as a hopping step). Then present the Healing Fungus to the old man, and
    a short cutscene will have them give it to you as a "pet" in exchange.</string>

    room you climb down into, go up so that you\'re in the semi-enclosed area between rocks below the mass of grass just to the left
    of the elevated area you climb down from. Cast Cyclone here and you will automatically be transported through a "cyclone ground

    battle Mud to earn out.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_17" formatted="false">When Mud is used in battle, the user lobs mounds of orange mud at the
    positions of each member of the enemy party. All enemies\' agility ratings are temporarily lowered down to 50%, the lowest value
    the Agility rating can be debuffed down to. This is identical to the effect of the Venus Djinni Vine in The Lost Age.</string>

    interest in the other main section of the caves). When you see it, it is standing unreachable at the edge of an abyss
    with an air spout on the cave wall above it. On either side of it is an earth pillar that can be pushed in front of an
    air spout. When both earth pillars are covering an air spout each, Flower will be blown off the edge and fall to the
    floor below. To properly follow it, slide down the second cliff slide to the right of Flower\'s position. It must be
    battled to be obtained, though definitely save before trying to get it.</string>

    it as opposed to the later portion accessible only with the Teleport Psynergy at the end of the game. Getting to the
    optional dungeon to begin with is complex in and of itself, making Meld essentially the "main reward" for first reaching
    Islet Cave. In the right watery room with rolling logs, after you roll right, simply go down to the horizontal log below
    and roll it up to Meld\'s position at the top of the area. It must be battled.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_19" formatted="false">Meld\'s battle effect is unique: Visually, it appears as
    the user and one of the other currently active party members attacking a target together. The Adept that is chosen
    to be the "second attacker" alongside the user is the Adept with the highest Attack rating other than the user. The
    damage calculation is based mostly on the "second attacker"; it is the second attacker\'s attack that is used as the
    base for the damage, and it is the second attacker\'s Venus power rating that is applied for elemental resistance
    calculations. However, during the attack the second attacker\'s Attack rating is treated as though it has additional
    attack rating equal to 25% of the user\'s own attack rating (meaning that 25% of the Meld user\'s own attack rating
    is the only contribution to the attack that Meld actually causes). If the user is the only currently alive Adept of
    the party members and uses Meld, the user will merely strike by itself and deal a Venus-based attack equal in power
    to the user\'s normal physical attack increased by 25%.</string>

    placed at the end of one stretch below a moai statue that spouts flowing water that prevents you from running up to
    reach it. You need to acquire the dungeon\'s Parch Psynergy first. Then climb up the right ladder and go up until
    you\'re just to the right of the top of the moai statue, and cast Parch on it. The flowing water will disappear.
    Climb down and walk up to Steam\'s position and battle it in order to earn it.</string>

    directly southwest of Tundaria Tower.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_21" formatted="false">When Wheeze is used in battle, the user leaps forward
    to strongly strike the target, and a thick array of glowing purple images of strange, blobby ghostlike creatures
    is exuded upon impact. It deals a Jupiter-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with
    an additional 50 damage points added to the result, and there is then a chance that the target will be afflicted

    to this room. Then from where you drop into, slide left, up, right, up, left, down, right, up, and right to bump into Reflux,
    then slide right so that you can then battle and acquire it.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_22" formatted="false">When Reflux is used in battle, the user is affected for the entire
    turn by a unique effect which has the "always strikes first" property; the user does nothing for the rest of the turn unless
    the user sustains some form of damage from an enemy\'s action, in which case the user will automatically counter attack with a
    visual taking the form of a glowing red, ellipsoid portal of sorts briefly manifesting and a holographic image of a Mars Djinni
    shooting out to collide with the offender like a bullet. This counts as a Mars-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal

    Following that, you may present the Dancing Idol key item that you had found and made use of in Gaia Rock to Uzume, and through
    another cutscene she exchanges Coal - a pet that has apparently become very dear to her - for the dancing doll of Mt. Mikage.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_23" formatted="false">When Coal is used in battle, all currently active and alive Adepts get

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_24">Haze is located in Apojii Islands, in the right area that is the edge of Gaia Falls.
    To get to its position at a ledge hanging over the literal end of the world, you need to have acquired the Sand Psynergy earned at
    Gaia Rock. Then in the town area, walk right along the beach until you get to a series of rocks, and cast Sand to bypass the rocks.
    Cross over in to the next screen upon the shallow water, go down, and perform what might appear to be suicide - jumping down over
    the waterfall and off the edge of the world. You land on a small ledge directly below you, thankfully. Go upward into a small cave
    area, and cast Whirlwind on the third of four bushes; the entrance revealed directly leads you to the Djinni for you to collect.
    Go back to the cave area, and go out of the southeast exit and cast the Lash Psynergy on the coiled rope to let yourself back
    onto land.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_24" formatted="false">When Haze\'s battle effect is used, a unique illusory effect surrounds
    the targeted Adept, and the Adept is suddenly turned nearly invisible, represented only by a white outline of the target\'s normal
    combat pose in motion, while the game reports that the Adept "vanishes into thin air!". For the rest of this turn, the Adept cannot
    be affected by any action or damage against it by any enemy. This effect has the "always hits first" property which makes it the
    first used action in a given turn regardless of the user\'s agility, though if multiple units use similar increased-priority effects,
    the one with the higher agility goes first.</string>

    by the boat and the Grind Psynergy. It is hidden in the southwest-possible patch of grass that you can\'t even reach physically.
    Standing two tiles to the right of it, cast Cyclone, and Rime will suddenly appear and jump into the lone statue in the center of
    the screen. Then use the Tremor Psynergy while facing the now-shaking Statue to make Rime appear again, and you can now collect it.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_25" formatted="false">When Rime is used in battle, a unique holographic visual of

    It then must be defeated to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_26" formatted="false">When Core is used in battle, a holographic image of a Mars Djinni

    located just to the right of the entrance, in the exact center of a large patch of grass. Despite how easy it is to get when
    one knows it\'s there, players playing without any outside information very often miss this Djinni because the first instinct
    with grass groups like this is to use Cyclone to blow them away. As a matter of fact, Salt is automatically acquired by casting
    Scoop in the one bare spot in the center of the grass. Unlike other items specifically buried in the ground and findable with
    Scoop, however, the Reveal Psynergy will not even indicate Salt\'s presence in the ground with a telltale glowing spot.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_27" formatted="false">When Salt is used in battle, all status ailments from all current battling

    actions this turn (meaning the enemy cannot attack at all this turn if it can only act once per turn, whereas a boss that can act
    twice a turn can only act once a turn). This acts first in battle regardless of the Agility ratings of the user and the target,
    and it shares its priority with other "acts first" moves.</string>

    box to shake similar to what can happen in Kibombo Mountains; you\'ll have to leave and reenter so that the puzzle resets itself if
    that happens, though.) From there, press the box right so that it falls further down, then use Move while standing below it to move
    it one step further right. You are now able to hop onto the top of the box and reach the series of wall ladders that connects to
    Tinder\'s ledge, as well as the cave on the opposite side containing a chest with 166 coins.</string>

    conduits for the Hover-based energy (similar to types of puzzles seen in Venus Lighthouse). Two such pillars are present,
    one a "corner" pillar and one a "line" pillar. Get up to the Corner Pillar with Hover, and move it over to the hole in the ground
    that the purple line of energy is feeding into, which causes the inactive hovering circle to the top center to be active. Use it
    to get to the line pillar, and move it off down to the ground level. Hover to the Poundable pillar to the other right and Pound it,
    ejecting the corner pillar from its slot in the ground. Now move the corner pillar to the lower left hole and the line pillar into
    the lower center hole, which will allow the lower left hovering tile to become active. Use that to hover to Whorl\'s position,
    save, and defeat it to acquire it. After that, simply use the lower left hovering tile to float to the upper left stairwell to
    progress to the next floor (you do not need to redirect energy flow again for the sake of activating the top left hovering tile).</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_32" formatted="false">When Whorl is used in battle, a holographic image of a Jupiter Djinni
    appears and sucks the target toward its position in midair for a moment using a reverse whirlwind of purple energy, before the
    target falls back down to the ground. It deals a Jupiter-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with
    an additional 40 damage points added to the result, provided its chance to instantly fell the target does not kick in.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_32">When set, Whorl increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Attack by 4, and base Defense by 2.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_location_33">Contigo, requires Force</string>
    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_33">Shine is hiding in the upper left hollow tree stump in Contigo, and is brought out
    into the open via the Force Psynergy. The big potential snag to getting this Djinni is that the Orb of Force that provides the Force
    Psynergy in the first place is only acquirable as an item in the inventory of Isaac\'s party when they join Felix\'s party late in
    The Lost Age… provided any form of Password data transfer is in effect so as to register that the Orb of Force has been collected
    from the previous game\'s Fuchin Falls Cave to begin with. The Orb of Force can otherwise be missed, or not present in Isaac\'s
    party at all as a result of The Lost Age being played through without password data transfer at all; if the game file is saved
    after Isaac\'s party joins but the Orb of Force is not present, it will be impossible to acquire Shine without a hacking device.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_33" formatted="false">When Shine is used in battle, a holographic image of a Mars Djinni briefly
    backs up while emitting several beams of light at various angles, and then charges through the target. The target is hit by a
    Mars-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 60 damage points added to the result,
    and then for each enemy on the enemy side (not just the target) there is a chance it will be afflicted with Delusion.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_33">When set, Shine increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Attack by 3, base Defense by 3, and base Agility by 2.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_location_34">Atteka Inlet, requires Lift</string>
    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_34">Geode is hidden within the lower left part of Atteka Inlet where the boulder is, and
    to have it appear you need to cast the Cyclone Psynergy - but to get to it, you need the Lift Psynergy, which you only get as part
    of the inventory of Isaac\'s party when they join Felix\'s party late in The Lost Age. In Geode\'s case in particular, though, it
    can be acquired very shortly after the reunion takes place because the game\'s plot progression dictates you go from Contigo to
    Atteka Inlet right away. So, before going to the screen where your ship is, fetch Geode in the pictured area.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_34" formatted="false">When Geode is used in battle, the entire background suddenly rolls
    itself up into a 3D-sphere, and a holographic image of a Venus Djinni propels it into the target, where the sphere detonates
    in a humongous, 3D explosion before the background reappears. It deals a Venus-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal
    physical attack increased by 90% - the highest consistent damage multiplier of all Djinn, and much greater than the damage
    multipliers of its otherwise similar counterparts Flint and Echo.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_34">When set, Geode increases the Adept\'s base HP by 12 and base Attack by 6.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_location_35">Shaman Village Cave, requires Lift</string>
    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_35">Eddy is found in the main, large area of the Shaman Village Cave, where there
    are various boulders between elevated ledges that may be Lifted. The proper way to reach it is to first enter the room from the
    bottom end, then Lift the rightmost boulder. Go up, hop left, go down, and lift the boulder to the left of that. Return, then
    Lift the left most boulder, and cast Frost on the puddle. You may now hop to where Eddy is, and when it tries to escape it will
    be blocked by the second-to-right boulder. You must then battle it to acquire it.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_35" formatted="false">When Eddy is used in battle, a holographic image of a Mercury Djinni
    floats above the party and causes arrays of bubbles to be absorbed into each Adept. It has the unique effect of instantly causing
    all of the current battling party members to go through one extra turn\'s worth of Djinn recovery time. The passing of a turn\'s
    worth of Djinn recovery time that transpires at the end of a given turn is unaffected, meaning that two Djinn in Recovery on each
    Adept will be re-Set this turn instead of just one when Eddy is used.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_35">When set, Eddy increases the Adept\'s base HP by 9, base Agility by 3, and base Luck by 2.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_location_36">Trial Road, requires Hover and Lift</string>
    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_36">Gasp is located in the hidden area beyond the "goal line" screen of Trial Road.
    It is only accessible after Isaac\'s party joins Felix\'s late in The Lost Age because it requires both the Hover Psynergy earned
    upon completing the Trial Road contest and the Lift Psynergy Isaac\'s party brings with them. At the exterior screen of Trial Road
    where the battle with Moapa and the two Knights took place, cast Hover on the glowing purple Hover tile, then cast Lift on the
    boulder blocking the way to a secret area with lots of grass clumps and Gasp present. Along with looting the other aspects of the
    area, go to either the top or the bottom of the lower left lake so that the Djinni is opposite yourself, cast Reveal to show a
    platform in the center of the lake, and hop onto the platform to get Gasp pushed off to the side so that it can be engaged in
    battle to be earned.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_36" formatted="false">When Gasp is used in battle, a holographic image of a Jupiter Djinni
    hovers shortly above the enemy party as a mass of ghosty, skeletal imagery morphs and bends through the party\'s position. All
    enemies have a chance to be afflicted with the 7-turn Countdown condition. It is essentially the Curse Psynergy being cast on all
    enemies at once.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_36">When set, Gasp increases the Adept\'s base HP by 12 and base PP by 5.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_37">Fury is found in the second, middle floor of Magma Rock, located to the far left of
    the lower horizontal hallway on an elevated platform. If you enter this hallway from the very tall black doorway to the right while
    the magma level is down, simply go left and climb up to where Fury is and battle it to attain it.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_37" formatted="false">When Fury is used in battle, a holographic image of a Mars Djinni floats
    above the party and projects a wide, fast, and long wave of skull-faced orange spirits through the target, dealing a Mars-based
    attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 70 damage points added to the result. There is then
    a chance that the target will be afflicted with Haunt.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_37">When set, Fury increases the Adept\'s base HP by 12 and base PP by 4.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_location_38">Loho, requires Magma Ball</string>
    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_38">Lull is present on one of the stone rooftops in Loho. It can only be accessible
    very late in The Lost Age because you need the Magma Ball collected at the end of the Magma Rock dungeon, which is itself only
    accessible after Isaac\'s party joins Felix\'s late in the game. When you have the Magma Ball, simply use it while standing behind
    the pointed cannon at the east end of town; after the wall it is pointed toward is removed and a cutscene transpires where the
    cannon is installed onto your ship, simply climb up the vine and go to the lower left, and hop onto where Lull is to collect it.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_38" formatted="false">When Lull is used in battle, a holographic effect of a Jupiter Djinni
    floats above the battlefield and projects an elaborate, swirling ring-shaped array of musical note images. The turn immediately
    ends; while all battle commands executed prior to Lull\'s usage this turn are unaffected, all of the battle commands that would have
    followed Lull\'s usage otherwise simply do not happen.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_38">When set, Lull increases the Adept\'s base HP by 11 and base PP by 6.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_location_39">Prox</string>
    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_39">Mold is present in Prox, found near the end of the game. First, enter the frozen,
    snowed-upon river and go up to the next screen under a bridge. Mold will be right in front of you; when you bump into it on the
    sliding ice, it will adorably slide back and get buried underneath a pile of snow. Simply slide up to where the snow is and cast
    Scoop to acquire Mold.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_39" formatted="false">When Mold is used in battle, a holographic image of a Venus Djinni
    briefly absorbs itself into the target, then one of two things may happen; if there is at least one other enemy to the side of
    the target, the target will physically attack the other enemy (which other enemy it will hit is randomly chosen if there is more
    than one other enemy than the target of Mold) while the battle text reports "[Enemy] attacks an ally!", and the struck enemy takes
    the resultant damage. Otherwise, if Mold is used on a lone enemy, the target is suddenly damaged while the battle text reports
    "[Enemy], stop hitting yourself!". (The mechanics of Mold certainly make it a much different sort of attack than the in-game
    description of “Strike a foe” would indicate.) In either case, the enemy that is physically struck is struck with a Venus-based
    attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 80 damage points.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_39">When set, Mold increases the Adept\'s base HP by 8, base Attack by 4, base Agility by 2, and base Luck by 1.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_40">Balm is located in Mars Lighthouse, in a large room with a slippery ice floor that
    you would have to go through on the first half of the dungeon on your way to the Flame Dragon boss battle. From where you enter
    the room, before stepping on the ice cast Move on the dragon statue to the immediate left and slide it to the left remotely. Then
    slide down, left, down, left, up, right, up, left, down, left, and down to place yourself just to the right of Balm. Battle it and
    earn it, then slide up to get to where you can get the Teleport Lapis.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_40" formatted="false">When Balm is used in battle, the entire party is surrounded by an elaborate
    visual of glowing blue holographic images of avian pinions falling down. Each of the downed Adepts in the current battling party has
    a 60% chance to be revived and cured to 60% of their respective maximum HP meters.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_40">When set, Balm increases the Adept\'s base HP by 13 and base PP by 4.</string>

    has been "turned on" and made hotter. From the "main lobby", enter the rightmost door, and you are led to Fugue pretty quickly.
    It must be battled in order to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_41" formatted="false">When Fugue is used in battle, a holographic image of a Mars Djinni
    floats above the party and projects a series of large, fast-moving glowing red symbols resembling musical notes in the enemy
    party\'s direction. Fugue damages the target\'s PP meters as though they were HP meters being damaged by a Mars Psynergy with
    a power rating of 19 and a range of All; if elemental strengths, weaknesses and resistances were not a part of the game,
    all enemies would lose about 19 PP, but the amount of PP-damage dealt will be raised if the user has a higher Mars power
    rating and the enemies have lower Mars resistance ratings. The amount of PP-damage will also be affected by other battle
    factors, such as being cut in half if the affected enemy is using the Defend command this turn.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_41">When set, Fugue increases the Adept\'s base HP by 11, base PP by 4, and base Defense by 2.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_42">Gale is located in the deeper, later part of the optional Treasure Isle dungeon
    that is accessible only with the Lift Psynergy that comes with Isaac\'s party when they join late in The Lost Age. Gale is in a
    particularly large room with several Lift-able boulders, presented as a puzzle just like the puzzle in Shaman Village Cave that
    rewards you with the Mercury Djinni Eddy. What is often not realized by players, though, is that Gale does not require to be
    "trapped" by a boulder that has been Lifted up (as pictured) because it will not try to get away via the space to its right even
    if the space is empty; all you need to do is to reach it and you will engage in the battle.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_42" formatted="false">When Gale is used in battle, a holographic image of a Jupiter Djinni
    appears and pushes the target away from the party using a projected whirlwind of purple energy extremely visually similar to that
    of Whorl. It deals a Jupiter-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 60 damage points
    added to the result, provided its chance to instantly remove the target from the battle does not kick in. When the target is
    removed from the battle, the battle text reports "[Enemy] was blown far away!", and if that was the only enemy in the battle,
    the battle immediately ends without any EXP or Coin rewards; otherwise, the enemy\'s sprite will instantly disappear, and the
    battle continues with the remaining enemies on the field. You will not get the EXP or Coin rewards from the enemy that was blown
    away, just for enemies that you actually fell.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_42">When set, Gale increases the Adept\'s base HP by 10, base Agility by 5, and base Luck by 3.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_43">Crystal is findable in the optional dungeon Yampi Desert Cave, an optional endgame
    dungeon accessible only with the Teleport Psynergy. When you eventually get to its area, you will find a group of sand on the ground
    where something under the sand appears in four designated spots in a predetermined pattern and at a moderately fast rate. Find a
    place where it appears, and at the moment the moving sand appears in front of you, cast Scoop - you can use the Select button to
    open the Psynergy menu and take your time casting Scoop while the sand pile is frozen in place by the fact that your game\'s
    Psynergy menu is open. Crystal is automatically battled once it is unearthed.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_43" formatted="false">When Crystal is used in battle, an elaborate, circular glowing orange
    symbol appears under the party\'s feet and rotates counterclockwise as orange energy is projected upwards through the party. All
    current battling Adepts have their HP meters restored by 50% of their respective maximum HP meters, making it superior to the
    otherwise similar effect shared by the Venus Djinni Flower and the Mercury Djinni Spritz.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_set_bonus_43">When set, Crystal increases the Adept\'s base HP by 10, base PP by 5, and base Defense by 2.</string>

    <string name="lost_age_catching_description_44">Serac is found in the long series of hallways in the portion of Islet Cave
    accessibly only with theTeleport Psynergy found at the end of the game. It is hiding in an elevated statue in the second of
    the four narrow hallways, and can only be brought down to reachability by casting theTremor Psynergy while facing toward the
    statue. The Djinni must be battled to be acquired.</string>
    <string name="lost_age_battle_effect_44" formatted="false">When Serac is used in battle, a holographic image of a Mercury Djinni
    goes into the ground at the target\'s feet and disappears as a 3D polygonal iceberg appears at the position of the targeted enemy
    in its place and the camera swivels around towards the enemy side\'s perspective, and then the user leaps forward to attack and
    shatters the iceberg. It deals a Mercury-based attack equal in power to the user\'s normal physical attack with an additional 70
    damage points added to the result, provided its chance to instantly fell the target does not kick in.</string>
